[Capital One Small Business Card website](https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/homepage/)

I am currently the lead engineer/engineering manager for the Small Business Card section of the Capital One website. I recently led modernized rebuilds of our [homepage](https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/homepage/), ["all cards" page](https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/) and ["product detail" pages](https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/spark-cash-plus/). The site is a Angular static site that pulls data and content from various sources such as an internal CMS, internal APIs, and external APIs.

Before leading the website team, I was a senior engineer for the Small Business Card web application team.

The application is an SSR React & Redux application.
