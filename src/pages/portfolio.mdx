import { AppLayout } from "../components/AppLayout";

export const meta = {
  title: "portfolio",
};

React component library built using Stitches. Its the component library used to build the website you're on right now!

[`jaylaiche.com`](https://github.com/LA1CH3/jaylaiche.com)

The website you are on right now. This website is built using Next.js, Stitches, and MDX.

export default ({ children }) => <AppLayout meta={meta}>{children}</AppLayout>;
