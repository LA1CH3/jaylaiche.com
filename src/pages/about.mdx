  title: "about me",
};

As you may have figured out by now, my name is Jay Laiche. I'm a software engineer based out of Richmond, Virginia.

I am currently a Lead Software Enginer/Engineering Manager at Capital One, working within their Small Business Card organization. I lead a team that works on the capitalone.com website.

While I have experience in the entire stack, my passion lies in the front-end. Specifically, I have a strong interest in design systems, web performance, and developer experience.

Outside of work, I love cycling (follow me on Strava), hiking (follow me on AllTrails) and spending time with my pitbull, Penny.

export default ({ children }) => <AppLayout meta={meta}>{children}</AppLayout>;
