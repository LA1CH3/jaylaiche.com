As you may have figured out by now, my name is Jay Laiche. I'm a software engineer based out of Richmond, Virginia.

I am currently a Lead Software Engineer/Engineering Manager at Capital One, working within their Small Business Card organization. I lead a team that works on the capitalone.com website.

While I am proficient in the entire stack, my passion lies in the front-end. Specifically, I have a strong interest in design systems, web performance, and developer experience.

Outside of work, I love cycling ([follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4869686)), hiking ([follow me on AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/members/jay-laiche)) and spending time with my pitbull, Penny.
